Image-Editor
============

A single paged JavaScript / PHP based tool that crops, resizes and reformats images to fit common social media sizes and allows the user to alter the result with HTML5 Canvas filters.

Currently: the user uploads an image (gif, png, jpg, jpeg) with HTML5's File and FormData APIs, the image is validated, renamed, converted to a jpeg and returned to them ready to crop, either freehand or with their chosen social media template. The cropped image is returned to the user. If the user attempts to close the browser tab the image is deleted from the server.

3rd stage - add download button, allow user to apply Canvas filters to the image.

4th stage - re-organise JavaScript and PHP. think of more stuff to add.
